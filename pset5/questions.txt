0.  a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary.
1.  returns resource usage measures
2.  16
3.  The getrusage function prototype expects a pointer
4.  For loop goes through each character from the input text file and check it for the EOF which means the end of the word and ignore 
    non alphabetical symbols like numbers, 
    than it puts a null terminator to the word and continue reading characters untill it read them all.
5.  We neen to check each letter to find the end of the words and find numbers or EOF symbols and fscanf won't do it as fgetc 
6.  Pointer to a constant character. You cannot use this pointer to change the value being pointed to
7.  I uses hash table size of 26 (from 0 to 25) for each letter and for each index it has singly-linked list in which were all words starting from same character.
8.  When it at last works, i couldn't make it mush more faster so medium time is 0.50 - 0.60.
9.  The main problem was checking and i couldn't make it much faster, maybe i should use recursion or something but i did with ordinary loops and a bit time it was to make world be lowercase.
10. Yes, i think that there are some issues with checking as other operations completed quite fast and i am not sure about doing a copy of word in case i can't change the const string to lowercase.
